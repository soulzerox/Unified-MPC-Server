# Install lnwjud on Linux

The first Linux release target is x64 on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. GNOME Wayland and
X11 are acceptance sessions; KDE Wayland is a smoke target. Linux arm64 has a
separate target-native artifact in the release matrix but remains preview until
Electron, native host, ripgrep, tunnel-client, optional media dependencies,
package smoke, and provenance all have matching production evidence.

## Install and verify

1. Download the matching x64 AppImage or DEB from the project release page. For
   Linux arm64 preview, choose the `arm64` artifact explicitly.
2. Verify `SHA256SUMS.txt` and the exact-commit provenance before running it.
   The bundled tunnel client is accepted by the build only after cryptographic
   Sigstore verification; a missing verifier fails the package build.
3. For an AppImage, make it executable and launch it from a user-owned path.
   For a DEB, install it with the distribution package manager in a disposable
   test environment before using it with real workspaces.
4. Add a project explicitly in Projects. lnwjud does not auto-register `/`, a
   mount root, or a home directory.

On Ubuntu 24.04, prefer the DEB: its installation hook configures the
application's AppArmor profile for Chromium sandboxing. Running an unpacked
binary or AppImage from an arbitrary path may be blocked by the host's user
namespace policy even when a shell `unshare` check succeeds. If startup reports
a sandbox error, use the installed DEB; do not disable the Electron sandbox or
the host-wide AppArmor policy. Native CI tests the installed DEB, while the
AppImage has a separate extraction/layout check.

The package includes Electron, target-native ripgrep, the official OpenAI
`tunnel-client`, and the bounded native-host protocol helper. System Node.js is
not required for the packaged Desktop app or the packaged STDIO launcher.

## Desktop session and permissions

Doctor displays the detected session without treating it as permission:

- **X11:** input and capture are limited to the active display session.
- **Wayland:** input and capture require a user-approved portal session. A
  previous approval is not an unattended replay grant.
- **Headless:** core MCP, files, Git, search, logs, backup, and other non-UI
  tools remain usable; UI-native calls are dependency-gated.

The Linux secure-storage backend must be a supported Secret Service/KWallet
provider exposed through Electron `safeStorage`. `basic_text`, `unknown`, a
locked keyring, or temporary unavailability blocks new persisted tunnel and
checkpoint secrets. lnwjud never enables plaintext encryption as a fallback.

For Wayland capture/input, install and run the desktop portal and PipeWire
services required by the desktop environment. Missing DBus, portals, AT-SPI,
or PipeWire is shown as a dependency state, not as a successful capability.

## MCP and tunnel setup

Use the packaged launcher path from the app's MCP panel, for example:

```text
/opt/lnwjud/lnwjud-mcp-stdio --workspace /home/user/project
```

The exact installation path depends on the AppImage/DEB layout. The launcher
executes the packaged Electron host with `--mcp-stdio`, keeps stdout MCP-clean,
and sends diagnostics to stderr. Always pass an explicit project path when
using a new installation.

For ChatGPT Secure MCP Tunnel, configure the Platform tunnel and runtime key
in Settings, keep the `tunnel-client` override empty, and let lnwjud select the
verified bundled client. The key is protected by the host secure-storage
provider and the tunnel targets the Desktop loopback MCP endpoint. The source
of the bundled client is the
[OpenAI tunnel-client release page](https://github.com/openai/tunnel-client/releases).
No tool call downloads an unverified executable or silently falls back to a
system copy.

## Scheduler and platform limits

Scheduled tasks use only the per-user systemd user-unit/timer namespace under
`~/.config/systemd/user/lnwjud-*`. If user systemd is unavailable, the
scheduler is dependency-gated and lnwjud does not mutate cron as a substitute.
The optional desktop autostart setting owns only
`~/.config/autostart/lnwjud.desktop`.

WSL, Windows Registry, Windows Sandbox, Windows PDF provider installation, and
Outlook/COM actions are `unsupported_platform` on Linux. LibreOffice/UNO,
AT-SPI, media, OCR, portals, and browser providers are dependency-gated and do
not block the core MCP surface when absent.

## Troubleshooting

- **Keyring unavailable:** start/unlock the desktop Secret Service or KWallet,
  restart lnwjud, and run Doctor again. Never put a key in a shell variable,
  unit file, or issue report.
- **Wayland action denied:** create a fresh visible portal session from the
  requested tool. A denial is expected to remain `permission_required`.
- **AT-SPI unavailable:** install/enable the `gdbus` utility and accessibility
  bus/service for the current desktop session; pixel capture is not substituted
  for semantic observation. The observer is bounded and reports a dependency or
  permission state when the bus cannot answer.
- **Browser not ready:** install Chrome/Chromium and start the managed CDP
  profile; Doctor distinguishes not installed from not running.
- **Tunnel not ready:** verify the bundled-client manifest, tunnel ID, and
  bounded diagnostics. Do not point the override at an arbitrary executable in
  a production release.

Support reports should contain distro/session type, architecture, version, and
redacted error codes only. Exclude tokens, keyring contents, environment dumps,
private paths, and raw journal output.
